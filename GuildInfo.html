    <h4>Our Mission</h4>

    <p>Raiding is something we enjoy, and we hope you do as well! It gives you a chance to meet new people, take part in the challenge of mastering the hardest content, obtaining epic gear, and the most important part; having a good time. We strive to be a non-hardcore yet competitive raiding guild with a “family-like” social atmosphere.</p>
    <br/>


    <h4>Our Vision</h4>

    <p>Our vision is to provide a serious raiding environment in a casual setting so that all players have a chance to enjoy end-game content. We are going to be raiding Normal, Heroic, and Mythic content after the release of Warlords of Draenor. We love to learn and grow as a team and ultimately to have a stellar time defeating difficult bosses.</p>
